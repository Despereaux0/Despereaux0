- 👋 Hi, I’m @Despereaux0  
- 👀 I’m interested in cybersecurity — especially penetration testing, threat analysis, and defensive security.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced red team techniques through TryHackMe, Hack The Box, and my personal Kali Linux lab.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source security projects, Capture the Flag (CTF) writeups, and tool development in Python or Bash.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vassant-veloo-gove) | [Email me](mailto:vassantgoveveloo@gmail.com)  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I built my first web scraper before I ever took a formal programming class — and I’ve been breaking and securing systems ever since.
